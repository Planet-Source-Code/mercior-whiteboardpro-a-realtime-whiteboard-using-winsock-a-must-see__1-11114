### Description

This is my second submission to PSC now, and its another internet app for you. Its a whiteboard using winsock... what this means is that you and a friend can connect, then when either of you draw on the whiteboard it appears on both your screens! You can both draw pictures together now! (oh, the fun!).<p>

Its a good demonstration of streaming data, and its just a pretty cool app anyway :). I've added a chat as well, just to make it a little more fun, and i even threw in a "save picture" for good measure :)<p>

Ive commented practically every line of code in this thing, in the hopes youre going to like it so much you'll actually vote for it! (My last submission only got 2 votes, and im still sour about that .. )<p>

Enjoy the code... And remember to VOTE!!!
